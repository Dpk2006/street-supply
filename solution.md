## 🧠 Project Idea
StreetVibe is a platform that connects **street food vendors** with **authentic raw material suppliers**. We aim to bring transparency, trust, and verified partnerships into the unorganized street food supply chain of India.

## 💡 Why It Matters
- Street food vendors struggle to find **trusted suppliers** for raw materials like masalas, oil, flour, paper plates, sauces, etc.
- Many suppliers don’t reach this customer segment due to **lack of discovery** or **trust issues**.
- There’s **no existing verified, review-based platform** for small-scale F&B supply in India.

## 🔍 Core Features

### 👤 Dual User Roles
- **Vendors**: Can search for suppliers based on area, rating, and raw material category.
- **Suppliers**: Can list their offerings, manage trial packs, set location-based visibility, and accept ratings.

---

### 🧪 Sample Trial System (Trust Builder)

To solve trust issues, we introduce a **trial-first discovery flow**:

1. **Free Trial Option**:
   - Vendors can order small sample packs at **half-price** to test product quality.
   - Vendors are allowed **1–3 trial orders/month**, verified via shop PAN, geo-tag, or Aadhaar.

2. **Supplier Incentive**:
   - Suppliers choose which products are eligible for trials.
   - A “Trial Score” is shown based on how many vendors liked their trial.

3. **Post-Trial Ratings**:
   - Vendors leave a rating after trying samples. These appear as “Trial Verified” reviews — boosting credibility.

---

### 🔄 Subscription Model (Post-Trial)

After trials, vendors can opt for a **flexible subscription**:

- **2-month low-cost plan** (₹X) to continue accessing the supplier network, special trial packs, and better delivery deals.
- Vendors get:
  - Access to **location-prioritized listings**
  - **Verified Supplier Tags**
  - **Vendor-Protection Policies**

---

## 📦 What Counts as "Raw Material"?

For street vendors, raw materials include:

- **Food Items**: masalas, oil, flour, sugar, sauces, chutneys, lentils, tea powder
- **Non-food**: paper plates, cups, tissues, cleaning liquids, packaging boxes
- **Bulk fresh goods** (optional): vegetables, bread, milk if local delivery is possible

---

## 🛡️ Vendor Protections

We ensure vendors feel safe:

- **COD for first orders**
- **Open box delivery**
- **Trial-before-bulk**
- **Verified supplier badge** (based on hygiene & fulfillment rating)

---

## 🚚 Delivery Logic

- Delivery through **Ekart** or regional courier partners.
- Geo-prioritized delivery to ensure **low cost & fast trial shipping**.
- Tracking + feedback loop built-in after delivery.

---

## 💰 Monetization

1. **Trial Credits for Suppliers**:
   - First 5 trial orders/month free
   - After that, suppliers pay small fee to keep enabling trials

2. **Vendor Subscription (Optional)**:
   - ₹X/month for premium filters, top-rated suppliers, delivery protection, and more

3. **Commission on Fulfilled Orders**:
   - Small % taken only when a real order happens post-trial
